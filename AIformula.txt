inputs:
    ball position x
    ball position y
    ball velocity x (because vector)
    ball velocity y (because vector)
    current platform angle (theta)
    current distance from target X
outputs:
    platform target angle (phi)

to consider - fluent or instant rotation of the platform? 

rewards:
time without lose +
each bounce ++
|x_target - x_ball| ~= 0 +++

finish attempt when ball gets out of bounds

special challenge = try to optimize strategy to keep the ball at y_target (range of y or y higher than # or smth like this)

LEVELS:
1. ball rolling on the plane - might be thrown up, but no bounce
2. add perfect bounce

Target:
keep the ball around specified X




note
after each restart, spawn the ball in a random position with random velocity (prepare generating alg, so that it is always possible to hit the ball)
